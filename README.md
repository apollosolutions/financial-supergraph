# Apollo GraphOS for Financial Services

This repo provides a demonstration supergraph for a financial services company. You can explore the schema and run queries against it in [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/apollo-financial-supergraph/home?variant=prod). We encourage you to also use the schema as inspiration for your own financial supergraph!

## View the schema
This demo is published to the [Apollo Solutions](https://studio.apollographql.com/org/apollo-solutions) GraphOS
org with the graph
id [apollo-financial-supergraph](https://studio.apollographql.com/graph/apollo-financial-supergraph).

You can also view and share the [public variant](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/apollo-financial-supergraph/home?variant=prod) to run queries right from Explorer.
