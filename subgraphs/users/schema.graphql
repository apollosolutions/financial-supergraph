"""
Require that the user is authenticated and verified as a real user in our system.
It does not enforce specific roles, just that header is properly defined.
For our example it just checks the existence of the `x-user-id` header in the request.
"""
directive @authenticated repeatable on OBJECT | FIELD_DEFINITION

"""
Require specific access to run resolvers of a field or object.
Default to requiring admin permissions to avoid accidental exposure.
If no auth is defined, it is open to all. See `@authenticated` for other combined usage.
The request role is parsed from the "x-user-id" header value.

Used in the @hasRole directive to do directive-based authentication control.
